# 🎃 Hacktoberfest 2018
Yet another hacktoberfest project!

>*“Eye of newt, and toe of frog, 
>*Wool of bat, and tongue of dog, 
>*Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting, 
>*Lizard's leg, and owlet's wing,— 
>*For a charm of powerful trouble, 
>*Like a hell-broth boil and bubble. 
>*Double, double toil and trouble; 
>*Fire burn, and caldron bubble.” 
>*__― William Shakespeare
